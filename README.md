In this project, we developed a series of machine learning models to predict car acceptability based on various attributes like buying price, maintenance cost, doors, capacity, luggage boot size, and safety. Utilizing R, we conducted an initial graphical exploration to understand feature significance, followed by detailed classification using logistic regression, LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis), and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithms. The project also involved advanced techniques like ordinal encoding, data splitting using the validation set approach, ROC curve analysis, 5-fold cross-validation, and bootstrapping to ensure robust model evaluation and selection. Our findings highlighted key predictors and their impact on car acceptability, demonstrating the powerful blend of data mining and machine learning in predictive analytics.
